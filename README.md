## Overview

This repository contains all my solved programming assignments of [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?languages=en) by deeplearning.ai on Coursera. It consists of 5 courses, starting with the very foundations of Deep Learning, i.e., how to build neural networks, I learnt about Optimization Algorithms, CNNs, RNNs and many more.
